I write programs and make models to acquire, transfer, store, analyze and derive insigths about human health from magnetic resonance imaging data drawing upon my knowledge and training in physics, biochemistry, nuclear nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. I have been lucky enough to be involved in varied and rewarding work that draws upon these skills as well as my ability to program in C++, python, shell scripts, MATLAB and to model data using analytical and machine learning models.

Because I am part of a rather small team, I also have the opportunity to help keep our servers serving, our web page running and develop backup and storage systems to store data from the many users of our imaging center. I have also literally swept the floors.
