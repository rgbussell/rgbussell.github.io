<h1>My Work</h1>

I am an R&D engineer working in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). I draw upon my experience and training in physics, NMR</br>
spectroscopy and MRI imaging to acquire, transfer, archive, and analyze data to derive insights about health and physiology</br>
from imaging data. I develop, implement and test methods to image vascular physiology, brain activity and structure.</br>
As part of a team of research assistants and engineers working at an imaging center, I provide technical oversight, physics</br>
and computer science skills to projects including protocol optimization, development and testing of data processing</br>
pipelines, assuring data quality and improving efficiency of methods and services.</br></br>

In my research and development role, I apply quantitative physical models to acquire data optimally and write computer</br>
programs in C++, Linux, python, MATLAB and other languages that enable MRI scanners to acquire the data that encodes</br>
useful information to answer research questions, and to transfer, store and process the data. This is interesting and</br>
varied work that has exposed me to hardware programming, image processing, modeling and analysis as well as methods to</br>
transfer, store and perform quality assurance tests on large data sets. On occasion, I build electronics that improve the</br>
sensitivity of existing hardware, and design and fabricate 3D printed fixtures and housings to position samples within</br>
that hardware for robust and optimal function.</br></br>

Working in a data engineering role, I design, specify and manage the deployment of data systems located on premises, at</br>
data centers and using cloud services. Working with systems administrators, hardware vendors and cloud service providers,</br>
I help specify and design these multi-server systems and deploy data pipelines on them that are used by many users of an</br>
imaging center.
