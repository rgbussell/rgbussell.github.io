Who am I?</br>
I am a research and development engineer working in magnetic resonance imaging. I draw upon my experience and training </br>
in physics, NMR spectroscopy and MRI imaging to acquire, transfer, store, analyze and derive insights about human health</br>
and physiology from magnetic resonance imaging data. In particular, I have worked on developing, implementing and testing</br>
methods to image vascular physiology, brain activity and brain structure.</br></br>

Specifically, I use physical models of tissue magnetization to optimize scan protocols and write computer programs to</br>
enable MRI scanners to acquire data that encodes useful information about brain and body structure and function. This is</br>
very interesting and varied work that has exposed me to hardware programming, imaging processing, modeling and analysis as</br>
well as methods to transfer, store and perform quality assurance tests on large data sets. Once in a while I alwso build</br>
some electronics to improve the sensitivity of our existing hardware, and create fixtures and housings to position samples</br>
within that hardwre.</br>

On a daily basis, I program in multiple languages, including linux shell scripts, C++, python, MATLAB and others. To store</br>
and process that data, I set up and help maintain multiple servers and cloud based processing systems and I work with the</br>
many users of our imaging center to troubleshoot, administer and further develop those systems.
