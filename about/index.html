<h1>My Work</h1>

I am an R&D engineer working in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). I draw upon my experience and training in physics, NMR</br>
spectroscopy and MRI imaging to acquire, transfer, store, analyze and derive insights about human health and physiology</br>
from magnetic resonance imaging data. In particular, I have worked on developing, implementing and testing methods to</br>
image vascular physiology, brain activity and brain structure.</br></br>

Specifically, I use physical models of tissue magnetization to optimize scan protocols and write computer programs to</br>
enable MRI scanners to acquire data that encodes useful information about brain and body structure and function. This is</br>
very interesting and varied work that has exposed me to hardware programming, imaging processing, modeling and analysis as</br>
well as methods to transfer, store and perform quality assurance tests on large data sets. On occasion I build electronics</br>
to improve the sensitivity of our existing hardware, and design and fabricate 3D printed fixtures and housings to position </br>
samples within that hardware for robust and optimal function.</br>

On a daily basis, I program in multiple languages, including linux shell scripts, C++, python, MATLAB and others. To store</br>
and process that data, I set up and help maintain multiple servers and cloud based processing systems and I work with the</br>
many users of our imaging center to consult on, troubleshoot, administer and further develop their imaging studies using</br>
these systems.

I also oversee a team of research assistants and engineers on technical development projects, bringing physics analysis</br>
and computer science experience to bear on development of data processing pipelines and data quality assurance.
